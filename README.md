# Plants health monitoring
 Plants health assessment using image analysis methods

## Goals
To optimize the use of water and fertilizers while producing food there is a need to assess plants health in real time. This can be done by analyzing images taken in different light conditions, optimially using camera capable of recording IR light.

## Methods
The following hardware was used:
* Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 with dedicated IO board
* Raspberry Pi Camera (1st generation)
* Raspberry Pi NOIR Camera (1st generation)
* IR LED
* four RGBW LEDs
