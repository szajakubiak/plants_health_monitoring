# Plants health monitoring
 Plants health assessment using image analysis methods

## Goals
To optimize the use of water and fertilizers while producing food there is a need to assess plants health in real time. This can be done by analyzing images taken in different light conditions, optimially using camera capable of recording IR light. Additional visible light filter can be used to quantify amount of IR light reflected by plant's leafs.

## Hardware
### Raspberry Pi computer with a day / night camera
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model A
* Camera module with IR filter controlled
* two IR LEDs
* four RGBW LEDs
* filter passing only IR light (wavelength from 700 nm to 1600 nm)
